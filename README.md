# Hi! 👋🏻 I'm Sophia.
Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile!

I'm a full-stack developer (II) for [Fat Fish Digital](https://fatfishdigital.co.uk/), a software development agency with a focus on health-tech & AI integrations.

Previously completed a bootcamp with [The Developer Academy](https://thedeveloperacademy.com/).

So far, I use mostly Node, TypeScript, NextJS and AWS, but I'm keen to learn more, especially new backend tools, Python, and new JS frontend frameworks.
