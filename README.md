# Hi! 👋🏻 I'm Sophia.
Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile!

I'm a full-stack developer, having just completed a bootcamp with [The Developer Academy](https://thedeveloperacademy.com/).

So far, I use mostly the MERN stack with NextJS, but I'm keen to learn more, especially new backend tools, Python, and new JS frameworks.

I'm looking for entry-level full-stack software development roles, to build on my existing skills and hopefully gain plenty of new ones.
I'm also looking for any opportunity to learn & grow my skillset, so very open to junior-friendly collaborations!
